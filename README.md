# Assemble Print System

Assemble's scrapbook (our judging and demoing platform) relied on [printing cardstock sheets for each shipped project](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble/blob/c91b344c889d6d9e098eb854379d4b194f59fa32/planning/judging.md#demo-cards). This codebase is a collection of the server and scripts used to automate printing.
